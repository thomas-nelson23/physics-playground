# Physics Playground

An interactive desktop app for exploring physics and algorithmic models on a live canvas. Pick a model, tweak its parameters with sliders, and poke at it with the mouse. Then play it like an instrument: a built-in step sequencer, a MIDI controller, or a song can drive every model through notes, macros and modulation.

Built with [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) (Rust shell, native webview) and TypeScript + Canvas 2D. macOS is the first target; Linux builds from the same code (`.deb`, AppImage, and a pacman package for Arch-based distros like CachyOS).

## Models

| Model | Category | Interaction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Particles & gravity | Particle physics | Drag to fling a body, Shift for a heavy one |
| Orbits | Particle physics | Drag to launch a planet (with a trajectory preview), right-drag for a star |
| Electric field | Particle physics | Click for + charge, right-click for -, drag to move, right-click a charge to delete |
| Cloth | Mechanics | Drag to pull the fabric, right-drag to slice it |
| Chaotic pendulums | Mechanics | Drag to aim, release to drop every pendulum |
| Ripple tank | Waves & fluids | Hold for a wave source, right-drag to draw walls |
| Ink in water | Waves & fluids | Drag to stir in dye, right-drag to stir without dye |
| Flocking (boids) | Algorithmic | Hold to attract, right-click or Shift to scatter |
| Game of Life | Algorithmic | Click or drag to draw cells |
| Reaction–diffusion | Algorithmic | Drag to seed chemical, right-drag to wipe |
| Falling sand | Algorithmic | Drag to pour sand, water, plants, fire or lava; right-drag erases |
| Slime mould | Algorithmic | Drag to drop food, right-drag to wipe trails |
| Chladni plate | Sound & music | Notes change the plate's vibration mode; drag to stir the sand |
| Harmonograph | Sound & music | The interval between notes sets the pendulums' frequency ratio; click for a fresh figure |
| String harp | Sound & music | Notes pluck the matching string; drag across strings to strum |
| Fireflies | Sound & music | Coupled oscillators that sync up and lock to the beat; hold to draw them in |

Shift works in place of right-click everywhere. Many models have preset dropdowns (slit experiments, reaction patterns, brush materials, colour schemes).

Keyboard: `Space` play/pause the simulation, `Enter` play/stop the sequencer, `R` reset, `.` single step while paused.

## Music

The panel under the canvas has four tabs.

- **Sequencer**: 16 steps with kick, snare and hi-hat rows and eight melody rows locked to a scale. It plays through a small built-in synth (or silently, with Sound off) and sends every hit to the current model.
- **Modulation**: routes that let a music source push a slider. Sources are note envelopes (any note, kick, snare, hat, melody), last velocity and pitch, held MIDI notes, tempo-synced LFOs, audio levels (overall, bass, mids, treble), the mod wheel, pitch bend and any MIDI CC. Targets are the model's number sliders and its macros. A coloured bar under a slider shows how far it's being pushed.
- **MIDI**: pick input devices, play notes through the synth, and map knobs with MIDI learn (click MIDI learn, click a slider or macro, turn a knob). Macro mappings carry across models.
- **Audio file**: play a song; its levels become modulation sources and its kick drums trigger note reactions.

Every model reacts to notes in its own way (notes drop bodies, pluck the cloth, fire dye jets, seed Life colonies, and so on), coloured by pitch where it has colour. Each model also has a few **macros**: single 0..1 knobs that push several parameters at once. Routes and macro settings are saved per model.

MIDI goes through the Rust side ([`src-tauri/src/midi.rs`](src-tauri/src/midi.rs), using `midir`) because the Linux and macOS webviews don't support Web MIDI. Messages reach the UI as `midi-message` events. On Linux that needs ALSA (`alsa-lib` on Arch, `libasound2-dev` to build on Debian/Ubuntu). In a plain browser (`npm run dev`) the app falls back to Web MIDI where the browser has it.

## Running it

Prerequisites: Node 20+, Rust (stable, via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)), and the [Tauri system dependencies](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS (on macOS that's just Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`).

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri dev     # desktop app with hot reload
npm run dev           # or just the UI in a browser at http://localhost:1420
```

Build a distributable:

```sh
npm run tauri build   # macOS: .app + .dmg   Linux: .deb + .AppImage
```

On Linux, install the webview deps first:

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf libasound2-dev

# Arch / CachyOS / EndeavourOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel webkit2gtk-4.1 librsvg alsa-lib rust nodejs npm
```

## Installing on Arch-based distros (CachyOS, EndeavourOS, Manjaro)

### Build a pacman package (recommended)

The repo ships a [`PKGBUILD`](packaging/arch/PKGBUILD) that builds the app from your checkout and installs it like any other package, with a launcher entry and icon.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
git clone https://github.com/thomas-nelson23/physics-playground.git
cd physics-playground/packaging/arch
makepkg -si
```

`makepkg -s` pulls in everything it needs (Rust, Node, `webkit2gtk-4.1`). If you already use `rustup`, that works too. Then launch **Physics Playground** from your app menu, or run `physics-playground`.

- Update: `git pull`, then `makepkg -sif` in `packaging/arch`.
- Uninstall: `sudo pacman -R physics-playground`.

The repo is private, so `git clone` needs you signed in to GitHub (for example `gh auth login`, or clone over SSH).

### Download a prebuilt package

Every push to `main` builds an Arch package in CI.

1. Open the repo's **Actions** tab, pick the latest **Build** run on `main`, and download the `physics-playground-arch` artifact.
2. Unzip it and install:

   ```sh
   sudo pacman -U physics-playground-*.pkg.tar.zst
   ```

### AppImage (no install)

The `physics-playground-Linux` artifact from the same run contains an AppImage that runs without installing anything. It needs FUSE 2:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed fuse2
chmod +x Physics*.AppImage
./Physics*.AppImage
```

The AppImage is built on Ubuntu and bundles its own libraries, so the pacman package is the better fit on Arch.

### Troubleshooting

- **Blank or white window, or a crash on start (common with NVIDIA drivers):** run with `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 physics-playground`. To make it stick, add `export WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` to your shell profile.

## Adding a model

Every model implements `SimulationModel` from [`src/models/types.ts`](src/models/types.ts). The host app owns the canvas, the fixed-timestep loop, the parameter sliders and pointer routing, so a model only describes its parameters and implements `reset`, `step` and `render` (plus optional `onPointer`, `onNote`, `resize` and `stats`).

1. Create `src/models/myModel.ts` exporting a `ModelDefinition`:

   ```ts
   import type { ModelDefinition, SimulationModel } from "./types";

   class MyModel implements SimulationModel {
     reset(view, params) { /* build state */ }
     step(dt, params) { /* advance state by dt seconds */ }
     render(g, view, params) { /* draw with the 2D context */ }
   }

   export const myModel: ModelDefinition = {
     id: "my-model",
     name: "My model",
     category: "Custom",
     description: "What it shows.",
     params: [
       { kind: "number", key: "strength", label: "Strength", min: 0, max: 10, step: 0.1, default: 1 },
     ],
     create: () => new MyModel(),
   };
   ```

2. Add it to the list in [`src/models/registry.ts`](src/models/registry.ts).

Sliders, checkboxes and dropdowns (`kind: "choice"`) are generated from `params` automatically. Mark a param `resetOnChange: true` if changing it should rebuild the simulation (e.g. a particle count).

To make a model musical:

- Implement `onNote(note, params)`. A `NoteEvent` has the MIDI `note`, `velocity` (0..1), a `role` (`"kick"`, `"snare"`, `"hat"` or `"tone"`) and `x`, the note's place in its range from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest), handy as a left-to-right position. `noteHue` in `models/lib/music.ts` gives a consistent colour per pitch.
- Add `macros`: each is a 0..1 knob with `targets: [{ param, amount }]`, where `amount` is a fraction of that param's range.
- Add default `modulations`, e.g. `{ source: "kick", target: "strength", amount: 0.2 }`, so music does something before anyone opens the Modulation tab.

Number params without `resetOnChange` can be modulated; the model always receives the modulated values in `params`.
